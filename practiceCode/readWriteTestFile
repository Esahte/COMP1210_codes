Text files contain textual data and may be saved in plain text or rich text formats. While most
text files are documents created and saved by users, they can also be used by software
developers to store program data. Examples of text files include word processing documents,
log files, and saved email messages.

Common text file extensions include .TXT, .RTF, .LOG, and .DOCX.
